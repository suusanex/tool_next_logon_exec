# codex-first-cost-router

Use this skill whenever ordinary development work should start or resume through the Codex-first cost-aware process.
Trigger it for natural requests such as "この issue を進めて", "このバグを直して", "この機能を実装して", "この PR の残件を片付けて", and "続きやって".

## Purpose

Route work by difficulty, risk, and edit permission without asking the user to choose a process, agent, subagent, model, or `full-coverage` branch.

The router owns:

- intake and source-of-truth detection
- state artifact creation / update
- model tier assignment
- agent / subagent delegation requirement
- READY / implementation permission
- routing plan and edit owner
- agent usage ledger and delegation compliance
- stop reason and residual classification
- close permission

## State artifact

Use `plans/<slug>/codex-first-state.md`.
If a better repo-local plan directory already exists, use that directory but preserve the same fields.

Minimum fields:

- task slug
- original user intent
- task weight
- selected process
- expansion required
- behavior spec artifact
- plan readiness
- case-to-plan mapping status
- behavior case coverage ledger artifact
- behavior case coverage ledger status
- `risk_triage_artifact`
- `risk_triage_artifact_status`
- replan required items
- current gate
- next gate
- recommended model tier
- model tier recommendation
- execution mode
- selected agent name / type
- agent / subagent plan
- configured model
- configured reasoning effort
- hook model
- reported model
- effective model
- routing plan
- edit permission
- delegation required
- required artifacts
- stop / ready gate
- current status
- stop reason
- human required items
- agent usage ledger
- delegation compliance
- artifacts created / consumed
- unresolved residuals
- next action
- operations not allowed in current state
- last updated summary

For "続きやって", read the newest matching state artifact before deciding the next step.

### Task Weight

Classify task weight before selecting the next gate.
Record the result in state as `task_weight` and `selected_process`.

| Weight | Typical signals | Default process |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trivial-local` | Obvious typo, formatting-only edit, no behavior change | `normal` or `lower-cost-delegated-scan`; state optional unless repo policy requires it |
| `small-bounded` | One component, clear acceptance, local checks available | `normal` |
| `medium-bounded` | Multiple files or tests, clear source of truth, manageable production risk | `normal` with bounded Plan and risk check |
| `high-risk-bounded` | Auth, security, DB, public API, production wiring, external SDK, async/event boundary, or compatibility uncertainty | `higher-model-review` or high-model Plan / risk / contract before READY |
| `needs-plan-behavior-expansion` | Source requirements have unexpanded behavior cases, negative expectations, recovery / rollback / retry / replay / cleanup, state transitions, or unmapped Case IDs | Plan gate stop; run behavior expansion or Plan rerun before risk/profile selection |
| `broad-full-coverage-candidate` | Ready Plan has broad scope, strongly interconnected changes, cross-slice contracts, multiple runtime sequences, or previous sequence / production-binding gaps | `advanced-full-coverage` candidate |
| `blocked-human-required` | Missing human decision, secret, external service operation, production/billing/GitHub settings change, or manual-only verification owner | `human-decision-wait` |

Classification axes:

- scope breadth
- ambiguity
- behavior expansion completeness
- Case-to-Plan mapping completeness
- production-binding risk
- external side-effect risk
- verification cost
- delegation suitability

Use `selected_process` values:

- `normal`
- `advanced-full-coverage`
- `human-decision-wait`
- `higher-model-review`
- `lower-cost-delegated-scan`

Do not ask the user to choose these values.
The router chooses them and records the reason.

### Execution Mode

Record one execution mode before treating a gate as complete.

- `ROUTE_ONLY`: intake, plan, risk, contract, or close judgment only; do not edit production code or tests.
- `DELEGATED_WORK`: the selected agent / subagent owns the bounded work; the parent owns aggregation, ledger update, and close judgment.
- `PARENT_DIRECT_WORK`: the parent works without agent / subagent delegation; record the reason and do not count it as cost-saving delegation.
- `TRIVIAL_PARENT_FIX`: a low-risk, local, explicit fix by the parent; record the reason and do not count it as cost-saving delegation.

If a gate required delegation and the parent directly performs the delegated work, set `delegation_violation = Yes` unless there is an explicit accepted `ParentDirectExecutionException`.

### Routing Plan

Before executing a gate, write this table to the state artifact.

```md
## Routing Plan

| Gate | Recommended tier | Delegation required | Expected agent type | Edit owner | Parent may execute directly? | Stop if unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

Rules:

- `CHEAP_MODEL` read-heavy scan, docs consistency, and artifact format checks SHOULD delegate to cheap agents when the work is more than trivial.
- `STANDARD_MODEL` READY implementation MUST delegate to `standard-implementer` when the parent is running as `HIGH_MODEL` or otherwise owns orchestration.
- `STANDARD_MODEL` READY verification MUST delegate to `standard-verifier` before close, unless close risk requires `high-closure-reviewer`.
- `HIGH_MODEL` plan, behavior expansion, risk, implementation handoff review, implementation contract, and dangerous close judgment may stay with the parent or high agents.
- Normal READY implementation requires an `implementation-handoff-review` artifact, or an explicitly equivalent pre-implementation gate, before selecting `standard-implementer`.
- Implementation handoff review requires the durable risk artifact `plans/<slug>-change-risk-triage.md`. Do not select `implementation-handoff-review` until `risk_triage_artifact_status = Complete`.
- When `Expansion required = Yes`, the handoff artifact must include `Behavior Case Coverage Ledger` and state must record `behavior_case_coverage_ledger_status = Complete` before selecting `standard-implementer`.
- A gate with `Delegation required = Yes` cannot be marked successful without observed delegation or an accepted parent-direct exception.
- A parent-direct exception is not a delegated cost-saving success. Record it as an exception, not as saved cost.

### Agent / Subagent Plan

The state artifact must include the selected owner for each relevant gate.

```md
## Agent / Subagent Plan

| Gate | Selected agent or subagent | Model tier recommendation | DelegationRequired | Required artifacts | Stop / Ready Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

`DelegationRequired` is `Yes` for normal READY implementation and normal READY verification.
It may also be `Yes` for read-heavy scan or docs consistency when the Routing Plan chooses cheaper delegated work.

`Required artifacts` should name the bounded Plan, state artifact, implementation contract, implementation-handoff-review artifact, behavior case coverage ledger, test evidence, or human decision needed before the gate can proceed.

`Stop / Ready Gate` must show either the blocking reason or the condition that makes the next gate READY.

### Edit Permission

Replace the old single `allowed to edit` decision with this block.

```md
## Edit Permission

- allowed_to_edit: Yes / No
- edit_owner: parent / standard-implementer / standard-verifier / high-planner / black-box-behavior-spec-kernel / implementation-handoff-review / high-implementation-contract / high-risk-triage / high-closure-reviewer / cheap-repo-scanner / cheap-doc-consistency / cheap-artifact-format-checker / human / none
- parent_direct_edit_allowed: Yes / No
- allowed_paths:
- forbidden_paths:
- required_authorization_artifact:
```

For READY implementation, default to `edit_owner = standard-implementer` and `parent_direct_edit_allowed = No`.
For READY verification, default to `edit_owner = standard-verifier` and `parent_direct_edit_allowed = No`, except for final close permission retained by the parent or `high-closure-reviewer`.

### Agent Usage Ledger

State artifacts must include expected vs observed delegation.

```md
## Agent Usage Ledger

### Expected delegation

| Gate | Delegation required | Expected agent | Expected tier | Edit owner | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Observed runs

| Run ID | Gate | Work item | Model tier | Agent name | Agent type | Configured model | Configured reasoning effort | Hook model | Reported model | Effective model | Delegation required | Edit owner | Delegation violation | Cost-saving delegation countable | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Use these meanings:

- `Model tier`: abstract route result, one of `HIGH_MODEL`, `STANDARD_MODEL`, or `CHEAP_MODEL`.
- `Configured model`: Codex custom agent file top-level `model`.
- `Configured reasoning effort`: Codex custom agent file top-level `model_reasoning_effort`.
- `Hook model`: model observed from hook payload or hook log, otherwise `unknown`.
- `Reported model`: model self-reported by the agent; lower-confidence than configured or hook evidence.
- `Effective model`: billing or runtime-effective model only when independently verified, otherwise `unknown`.
- `Delegation violation`: `Yes` when required delegation was replaced by parent-direct work or the wrong owner edited.
- `Cost-saving delegation countable`: `Yes` only when delegated run evidence exists, the owner matches the route, and no delegation violation occurred.

### Delegation compliance

| Check | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CHEAP work delegated when required | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| STANDARD implementation delegated | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| STANDARD verification delegated | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| Parent direct execution exception documented | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| Delegation violation absent or accepted | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| Cost-saving delegation has observed delegated run evidence | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
```

## Gates

### Intake / Request understanding

Default tier: `STANDARD_MODEL`.
Use `HIGH_MODEL` when the request is broad, ambiguous, or high risk.

Do:

- identify issue / PR / branch / file / supplied text inputs
- read repo instructions before editing
- separate work assumptions from missing information
- avoid immediate implementation

### Plan / Goal framing

Default tier: `HIGH_MODEL`.
Use `STANDARD_MODEL` only for small, explicit fixes.

Do:

- create or consume a bounded Parent Plan or equivalent artifact
- record `Expansion required`, `behavior_spec_artifact`, `Case-to-Plan mapping`, and `Plan readiness`
- record acceptance criteria, non-goals, and completion criteria
- preserve the Plan as source of truth for later gates
- stop with `NeedsPlanBehaviorExpansion` when source-to-case expansion or Case-to-Plan mapping is missing
- stop with `NeedsHumanDecision` when expected behavior or negative expectation cannot be safely inferred
- proceed to Risk only when `Plan readiness = ReadyForRiskTriage`

Do not:

- treat requirement-elaboration gaps as `broad-full-coverage-candidate`
- select `advanced-full-coverage` before `ReadyForRiskTriage`
- implement before Plan readiness is recorded

### Risk triage

Default tier: `STANDARD_MODEL`.
Use `HIGH_MODEL` for broad, ambiguous, security, auth, DB, public API, external SDK, async, or production wiring risk.

Do:

- require `Plan readiness = ReadyForRiskTriage` before selecting runtime contracts, risk class, or process profile
- create or update `plans/<slug>-change-risk-triage.md` as the durable Change Risk Triage artifact
- record `risk_triage_artifact` and `risk_triage_artifact_status` in state
- classify implementation-realization risk
- decide whether standard routing can bound the work safely
- treat full-coverage 3-layer operation as advanced route only
- route `NeedsPlanBehaviorExpansion` back to behavior expansion / Plan rerun, not full-coverage

### Repository scan / evidence collection

Default tier: `CHEAP_MODEL`.
Use `STANDARD_MODEL` if the scan directly affects implementation API choice.

Do:

- delegate read-heavy search, inventory, and consistency checks to `cheap-repo-scanner`, `cheap-doc-consistency`, or `cheap-artifact-format-checker` when delegation is required by the Routing Plan
- summarize findings instead of dumping raw output
- avoid final implementation decisions inside cheap scan work

### Implementation contract / design decision

Default tier: `HIGH_MODEL`.
Use `STANDARD_MODEL` only when API surface and implementation approach are already obvious.

Do:

- choose the implementation approach
- resolve SDK / API / dependency uncertainty
- split human decisions from implementation work
- stop with `NeedsHumanDecision` or `NeedsHigherModelReview` when needed

### Implementation handoff review / READY authorization

Default tier: `HIGH_MODEL`.
Use `STANDARD_MODEL` only when the artifact chain is simple and already complete.

Do:

- run `implementation-handoff-review` or an explicitly equivalent pre-implementation gate before normal READY implementation
- require `risk_triage_artifact_status = Complete` and the `plans/<slug>-change-risk-triage.md` artifact before starting handoff review
- create or update the parent authorization artifact, normally `plans/<slug>-implementation-handoff-review.md`
- record `behavior_case_coverage_ledger_artifact` and `behavior_case_coverage_ledger_status` in state
- require `Behavior Case Coverage Ledger` when `Expansion required = Yes`
- keep `standard-implementer` unavailable until the ledger status is `Complete`
- stop with `BlockedByBehaviorCaseCoverageLedger` when the ledger is missing, incomplete, `UnmappedBlocking`, or has pre-implementation `NeedsHumanDecision`

### Implementation

Default tier: `STANDARD_MODEL`.
Use `CHEAP_MODEL` only for simple, local, low-risk edits.

Do:

- set `Delegation required = Yes` and `Edit owner = standard-implementer` for normal READY implementation
- require the implementation-handoff-review parent authorization artifact before selecting `standard-implementer`
- when `Expansion required = Yes`, require `behavior_case_coverage_ledger_status = Complete`
- delegate READY implementation serially to `standard-implementer`; serial delegation is required even when write-heavy parallel editing is not allowed
- implement only READY scope
- stop if the required parent authorization artifact is missing
- stop if new design uncertainty appears
- avoid external API, production, secret, or billing side effects
- avoid endless repair loops
- stop with `DelegationUnavailable`, `ParentDirectExecutionException`, or `NeedsHigherModelReview` if required delegation cannot run

### Test / verification

Default tier: `STANDARD_MODEL`.
Use `CHEAP_MODEL` for formal docs consistency and formatting checks.
Use `HIGH_MODEL` for risky close judgment.

Do:

- set `Delegation required = Yes` and `Edit owner = standard-verifier` for normal READY verification
- delegate verification to `standard-verifier`; use `high-closure-reviewer` when close judgment is risky
- map evidence to Plan acceptance criteria
- distinguish fake / mock / stub success from production readiness
- record manual-only verification explicitly

### Close / residual decision

Default tier: `STANDARD_MODEL`.
Use `HIGH_MODEL` for broad impact, difficult residual decisions, or uncertain acceptance coverage.

Do:

- keep `ManualVerificationRequired`, `NeedsHumanDecision`, and `NeedsHigherModelReview` from closing
- keep `DelegationRequired` gates from closing when no observed run or accepted exception exists
- require `DelegationCompliance = PASS` or `DelegationCompliance = EXCEPTION_ACCEPTED` with explicit human decision
- distinguish `ReadyToClose` from `ReadyToCloseWithAcceptedResiduals`
- record accepted residuals and their owner

## Model tier labels

- `HIGH_MODEL`: hard judgment, ambiguity, security/auth/DB/public API/production wiring, implementation contract, risky close.
- `STANDARD_MODEL`: normal implementation, verification, test work, moderate repairs.
- `CHEAP_MODEL`: scan, inventory, docs consistency, artifact formatting, simple local fixes.

Do not hard-code real model names. Maintainers own the mapping.
Do not treat natural-language model text in agent output as the source of truth for execution settings. The custom agent TOML top-level fields are configured values; hook observations and reported values are separate ledger fields.

## Predefined agents / subagents

Use the package agents as role descriptions for delegation.
For Codex-readable custom agent files with concrete `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` defaults, use `profiles/codex-first/agents/*.toml`.

- `high-planner`
- `black-box-behavior-spec-kernel`
- `high-risk-triage`
- `implementation-handoff-review`
- `high-implementation-contract`
- `high-closure-reviewer`
- `standard-implementer`
- `standard-verifier`
- `cheap-repo-scanner`
- `cheap-doc-consistency`
- `cheap-artifact-format-checker`

Subagents are a way to assign bounded work to the right tier.
They still require explicit subagent / parallel work instructions from the parent thread or launcher.
Do not make write-heavy parallel editing the default.
This does not permit parent-direct implementation: READY implementation is serial delegated work owned by `standard-implementer` unless a recorded exception is accepted.
When parent-direct work is accepted, record `execution_mode = PARENT_DIRECT_WORK` or `TRIVIAL_PARENT_FIX`; do not count it as cost-saving delegation.
